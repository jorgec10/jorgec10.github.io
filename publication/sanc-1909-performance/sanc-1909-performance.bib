 abstract = {One of the verticals that will be more benefited with the arrival of
upcoming 5G deployments are smart-cities. Under this umbrella, different
applications for end-users will be developed in two principal scenarios in
the city, namely, under mobility conditions or in static situations. In
order to provide ubiquitous connectivity in these scenarios, the Low
Power-Wide Area Network (LP-WAN) technologies have emerged, hence enabling
the development of novel Internet of Things (IoT) services. In this line,
LoRaWAN is one of the most prominent LP-WAN alternatives that is considered
to be integrated within the 5G ecosystem. In this work, we focus on
evaluating the performance of this technology under different working
conditions. A comparison between two commercial LoRaWAN gateways is
presented and the attained results in both deployments are compared and
discussed. The outcomes place LoRaWAN as an outstanding solution to be
adopted in smart-city deployments for supporting certain IoT applications.},
