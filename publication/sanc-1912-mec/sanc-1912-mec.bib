 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a key horizontal technology
enabler within the 5G ecosystem, characterized by supporting the
heterogeneity of end-devices, radio-access technologies, and services.
Network slicing techniques allow to configure dedicated networks with
assured resources to specific users or applications over a common physical
infrastructure.This paper describes a novel end-to-end network slicing
framework for IoT services in 5G systems, based on a Multi-Access Edge
Computing (MEC) and central cloud architecture that permits the flexible
and dynamic placement of micro-services encapsulated as Virtualized Network
Functions (VNFs) along the end-to-end path. The critical analysis of the
validation results highlights the performance and flexibility gains of our
proposal. It allows deploying end-to-end slices over a number of
participating domains in a very short time, it is able to isolate slices
with guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) parameters and shows great
scalability in terms of number of connected end-devices and application
services.},
