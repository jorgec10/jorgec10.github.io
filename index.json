To this end, on-board units are expected to send messages periodically or upon the appearance of a relevant event, to feed an awareness ecosystem that enables safety or traffic efficiency services. This is the case of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) in Europe, which contain basic vehicle information such as its position or speed, among other parameters. From a network security perspective, CAMs are broadcasted unencrypted over an unprotected radio channel, hence enabling their potential interception and the disclosure of sensitive data. Although public key infrastructures (PKI)-like solutions have been proposed, high computational cost of asymmetric cryptography to cipher application data remains a challenge and a confidentiality alternative is needed. In this work, we present the implementation and evaluation of a symmetric encryption scheme based on disjoint security domains distributed in geographical areas. In the solution, vehicles are able to coordinate and agree on common keys to be used in different security zones. Simulation results show the validity of the zone encryption scheme in diverse vehicular scenarios with different traffic densities. A potential issue in the zone key redistribution consisting in the propagation of wrongly-generated duplicated keys is also detected, which is discussed in detail and a reliable solution based on the support of third-party data-forwarders is proposed and tested. Evaluations reveal good performance of the zone encryption mechanism in terms of robustness and latency, guaranteeing the efficient access to a secured channel while maintaining low computing load.","tags":["Zone encryption","Vehicular networks","C-ITS","V2V","Security"],"title":"Evaluation of a zone encryption scheme for vehicular networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jesus Sanchez-Gomez","Jorge Gallego-Madrid","Ramon Sanchez-Iborra","Jose Santa","Antonio Fernando Skarmeta Gomez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"2dcf63f3e7076f191e3b22d0e21d4bc8","permalink":"/publication/sanchez-gomez-2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-07T09:29:44.891084Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sanchez-gomez-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Impact of SCHC Compression and Fragmentation in LPWAN: A Case Study with LoRaWAN","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ramon Sanchez-Iborra","Jose Santa","Stefan Covaci","Jesus Sanchez-Gomez","Jorge Gallego-Madrid","Antonio Fernando Skarmeta Gomez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"6a7b9875e5dde5260e39f4b3d30c7a07","permalink":"/publication/sanc-1912-mec/","publishdate":"2019-10-07T13:49:38.568866Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sanc-1912-mec/","section":"publication","summary":"The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a key horizontal technology enabler within the 5G ecosystem, characterized by supporting the heterogeneity of end-devices, radio-access technologies, and services. Network slicing techniques allow to configure dedicated networks with assured resources to specific users or applications over a common physical infrastructure.This paper describes a novel end-to-end network slicing framework for IoT services in 5G systems, based on a Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) and central cloud architecture that permits the flexible and dynamic placement of micro-services encapsulated as Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) along the end-to-end path.

Under this umbrella, different applications for end-users will be developed in two principal scenarios in the city, namely, under mobility conditions or in static situations. In order to provide ubiquitous connectivity in these scenarios, the Low Power-Wide Area Network (LP-WAN) technologies have emerged, hence enabling the development of novel Internet of Things (IoT) services. In this line, LoRaWAN is one of the most prominent LP-WAN alternatives that is considered to be integrated within the 5G ecosystem. In this work, we focus on evaluating the performance of this technology under different working conditions. A comparison between two commercial LoRaWAN gateways is presented and the attained results in both deployments are compared and discussed. The outcomes place LoRaWAN as an outstanding solution to be adopted in smart-city deployments for supporting certain IoT applications.","tags":null,"title":"Performance Study of LoRaWAN for Smart-City Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ramon Sanchez-Iborra","José Santa","Jorge Gallego-Madrid","Stefan Covaci","Antonio Skarmeta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"f18d3c84f1228d47a9ee65e7609ddde2","permalink":"/publication/s-19143107/","publishdate":"2019-10-07T13:49:38.571015Z","relpermalink":"/publication/s-19143107/","section":"publication","summary":"Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a hot research niche exploiting the synergy between Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) and the Internet of Things (IoT), which can greatly benefit of the upcoming development of 5G technologies. The variety of end-devices, applications, and Radio Access Technologies (RATs) in IoV calls for new networking schemes that assure the Quality of Service (QoS) demanded by the users. To this end, network slicing techniques enable traffic differentiation with the aim of ensuring flow isolation, resource assignment, and network scalability. This work fills the gap of 5G network slicing for IoV and validates it in a realistic vehicular scenario. It offers an accurate bandwidth control with a full flow-isolation, which is essential for vehicular critical systems. The development is based on a distributed Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) architecture, which provides flexibility for the dynamic placement of the Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) in charge of managing network traffic. The solution is able to integrate heterogeneous radio technologies such as cellular networks and specific IoT communications with potential in the vehicular sector, creating isolated network slices without risking the Core Network (CN) scalability. The validation results demonstrate the framework capabilities of short and predictable slice-creation time, performance/QoS assurance and service scalability of up to one million connected devices.","tags":null,"title":"Empowering the Internet of Vehicles with Multi-RAT 5G Network Slicing","type":"publication"}]
